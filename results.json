  "prompt": "A spontaneous medium format photograph, as if taken with a Mamiya 7, captures the joyful moment of a young Caucasian Chilean man in his 30s, beaming and smiling, running through a crowd during a marathon he's participating in in Santiago, Chile. It's as if he happened to be passing by and looked directly at the camera, surrounded by other runners. All dressed like athletes, wearing with their distinctive number patches on the chest, sweaty but cheerful. The atmosphere is vibrant and joyful, capturing a moment of joy during the competition. The image has a natural, documentary feel, with intense colors, soft film grain, and the distinctive depth of field of a medium format camera. The lighting is natural and soft, evoking a sense of realism and warmth. The composition feels authentic and spontaneous, capturing a real, unique, almost fleeting moment... a very emotional one that evokes the joy of feeling alive. --profile fc83cdh\n[)",
